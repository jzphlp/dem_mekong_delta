Spatial leave-pair-out cross-validation is a type of cross-validation that is commonly used in spatial analysis and geostatistics. In this method, the dataset is split into pairs of adjacent spatial locations (e.g., pairs of neighboring pixels or grid cells), and each pair is held out in turn as the validation set while the rest of the data is used to train the model. This process is repeated for all possible pairs, and the performance of the model is averaged across all iterations.

Here's some sample code that demonstrates how to implement spatial leave-pair-out cross-validation in Python using the scikit-learn library:
